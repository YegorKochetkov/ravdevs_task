# [Demo](https://ravdevs-task.vercel.app/)

## Part 1 (tasks)

In folder tasks, you run tests:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

## Part 2

Make three separate pages with this Svelte Kit:

- SignUp, ResultV1, ResultV2

### Working stack

sass, vite, svelte-kit, svelte-store

#### SignUp

Contains two forms with the following fields:

form #1:
—ÅarBrand
zipCode

form #2:
firstName
lastName
carModel
firstRegistartion

Each form has a back button & next button, which takes a step behind\forward.

Those field has its own validation rules:
car Brand( Audi, BMW, Nissan )
zipCode ( 65000, 66000, 67000, 68000 )

All rest fields are just required, without validation rules.

Validation error message - show a pop-up window with a relevant message. For example that the brand or postal code is unfortunately not serviced.

If all right - move to the next step

ResultV1:

Display all previously entered data. Components are designed by our choice.

ResultV2:

Same as ResultV1, but:
First Name + Last Name displayed in one field as FullName
Car Model + Car Brand displayed in one field as Car.

Logic flow:

- Step 1 - shows form #1
- Step 2 - shows form #2
- Step 3 - shows ResultV1/ResultV2 page

After pressing next on step 2 - show a loading window with a progress bar of 0-100% for 6 seconds with a simulated load, after which the redirection randomly to ResultV1 or ResultV2 page

Note:

- Pages ResultV1 and ResultV2 can use one wrapper.
- No need to use a router to switch to ResultV1/ResultV2 just use a normal redirect
- Steps in SignUp page switches with animation

## Building

Clone the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
